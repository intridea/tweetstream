TweetStream
===========

TweetStream provides simple Ruby access to [Twitter's Streaming API](http://developer.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api).

Installation
------------

To install:

    gem install tweetstream

Usage
-----

Using TweetStream is quite simple:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'tweetstream'

    TweetStream.configure do |config|
      config.consumer_key = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
      config.consumer_secret = '0123456789'
      config.oauth_token = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
      config.oauth_token_secret = '0123456789'
      config.auth_method = :oauth
      config.parser   = :yajl
    end

    # This will pull a sample of all tweets based on
    # your Twitter account's Streaming API role.
    TweetStream::Client.new.sample do |status|
      # The status object is a special Hash with
      # method access to its keys.
      puts "#{status.text}"
    end

You can also use it to track keywords or follow a given set of
user ids:

    # Use 'track' to track a list of single-word keywords
    TweetStream::Client.new.track('term1', 'term2') do |status|
      puts "#{status.text}"
    end

    # Use 'follow' to follow a group of user ids (integers, not screen names)
    TweetStream::Client.new.follow(14252, 53235) do |status|
      puts "#{status.text}"
    end

The methods available to TweetStream::Client will be kept in parity
with the methods available on the Streaming API wiki page.

Using the Twitter Userstream
----------------------------

Using the Twitter userstream works similarly to the regular streaming, except you use the userstream method.

    # Use 'userstream' to get message from your stream
    TweetStream::Client.new.userstream do |status|
      puts status.text
    end


You also can use method hooks for both regular timeline statuses and direct messages.

    client = TweetStream::Client.new

    client.on_direct_message do |direct_message|
      puts "direct message"
      puts direct_message.text
    end

    client.on_timeline_status do |status|
      puts "timeline status"
      puts status.text
    end

    client.userstream

Configuration and Changes in 1.1.0
----------------------------------

As of version 1.1.0.rc1 TweetStream supports OAuth.  Please note that in order
to support OAuth, the `TweetStream::Client` initializer no longer accepts a
username/password.  `TweetStream::Client` now accepts a hash:

    TweetStream::Client.new(:username => 'you', :password => 'pass')

Alternatively, you can configure TweetStream via the configure method:

    TweetStream.configure do |config|
      config.consumer_key = 'cVcIw5zoLFE2a4BdDsmmA'
      config.consumer_secret = 'yYgVgvTT9uCFAi2IuscbYTCqwJZ1sdQxzISvLhNWUA'
      config.oauth_token = '4618-H3gU7mjDQ7MtFkAwHhCqD91Cp4RqDTp1AKwGzpHGL3I'
      config.oauth_token_secret = 'xmc9kFgOXpMdQ590Tho2gV7fE71v5OmBrX8qPGh7Y'
      config.auth_method = :oauth
      config.parser   = :yajl
    end

If you are using Basic Auth:

    TweetStream.configure do |config|
      config.username = 'username'
      config.password = 'password'
      config.auth_method = :basic
      config.parser   = :yajl
    end

TweetStream assumes OAuth by default.  If you are using Basic Auth, it is recommended
that you update your code to use OAuth as Twitter is likely to phase out Basic Auth
support.

Swappable JSON Parsing
----------------------

As of version 1.1, TweetStream supports swappable JSON backends via MultiJson. You can
specify a parser during configuration:

    # Parse tweets using Yajl-Ruby
    TweetStream.configure do |config|
      ..
      config.parser   = :yajl
    end.

Available options are `:yajl`, `:json_gem` (default),
`:json_pure`, and `:active_support`.

Handling Deletes and Rate Limitations
-------------------------------------

Sometimes the Streaming API will send messages other than statuses.
Specifically, it does so when a status is deleted or rate limitations
have caused some tweets not to appear in the stream. To handle these,
you can use the on_delete and on_limit methods. Example:

    @client = TweetStream::Client.new

    @client.on_delete do |status_id, user_id|
      Tweet.delete(status_id)
    end

    @client.on_limit do |skip_count|
      # do something
    end

    @client.track('intridea')

The on_delete and on_limit methods can also be chained, like so:

    TweetStream::Client.new.on_delete{ |status_id, user_id|
      Tweet.delete(status_id)
    }.on_limit { |skip_count|
      # do something
    }.track('intridea') do |status|
      # do something with the status like normal
    end

You can also provide `:delete` and/or `:limit`
options when you make your method call:

    TweetStream::Client.new.track('intridea',
      :delete => Proc.new{ |status_id, user_id| # do something },
      :limit => Proc.new{ |skip_count| # do something }
    ) do |status|
      # do something with the status like normal
    end

Twitter recommends honoring deletions as quickly as possible, and
you would likely be wise to integrate this functionality into your
application.

Errors and Reconnecting
-----------------------

TweetStream uses EventMachine to connect to the Twitter Streaming
API, and attempts to honor Twitter's guidelines in terms of automatic
reconnection. When Twitter becomes unavailable, the block specified
by you in `on_error` will be called. Note that this does not
indicate something is actually wrong, just that Twitter is momentarily
down. It could be for routine maintenance, etc.

    TweetStream::Client.new.on_error do |message|
      # Log your error message somewhere
    end.track('term') do |status|
      # Do things when nothing's wrong
    end

However, if the maximum number of reconnect attempts has been reached,
TweetStream will raise a `TweetStream::ReconnectError` with
information about the timeout and number of retries attempted.

Terminating a TweetStream
-------------------------

It is often the case that you will need to change the parameters of your
track or follow tweet streams. In the case that you need to terminate
a stream, you may add a second argument to your block that will yield
the client itself:

    # Stop after collecting 10 statuses
    @statuses = []
    TweetStream::Client.new.sample do |status, client|
      @statuses << status
      client.stop if @statuses.size >= 10
    end

When `stop` is called, TweetStream will return from the block
the last successfully yielded status, allowing you to make note of
it in your application as necessary.

Daemonizing
-----------

It is also possible to create a daemonized script quite easily
using the TweetStream library:

    # The third argument is an optional process name
    TweetStream::Daemon.new('username','password', 'tracker').track('term1', 'term2') do |status|
      # do something in the background
    end

If you put the above into a script and run the script with `ruby scriptname.rb`, you will see a list of daemonization commands such
as start, stop, and run.

TODO
----

* UserStream support
* SiteStream support

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
